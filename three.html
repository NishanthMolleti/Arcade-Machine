	<h3>In this game all you have to do is guess the number in my mind . In order to do that you will be given certain clues . These clues are in hte form of cows and bull . My number consists of 3 digits . Your guess must also consist of 3 digits . Any of the digit in my number matches that of yours and is in incorrect position I name it a cow and if the digit is in correct position I name it a bull.If you get 3 bulls you win . <br />


		For example , if my number is 137 and your guess is 153 . 1 is the bull and 3 is the cow . So your number consists of 1 bull and 1 cow.<br />
